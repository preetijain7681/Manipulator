# Mobile Manipulator
Simulation project of a 5DOF mobile manipulator 
Tasks:
1. Perform Pick and place operation on kuka Youbot in CoppeliaSim( Capstone project of specialisation)
2. Understand basics of perception( It's implementation using ROS, YOLO in CoppeliaSim)
3. Implement tasks like operating screw driver or typing on a keyboard on a mobile manipulator( Final goal of the project is to be able to perform URC tasks in simulation)
